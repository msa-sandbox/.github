# MSA Sandbox

**MSA Sandbox** is a playground for experimenting and gaining hands-on experience with **microservices architecture**.

The goal is to build and explore the core building blocks of modern distributed systems:

- Authentication and authorization service (JWT, access/refresh tokens)
- Admin panel for managing user roles and permissions
- API service with business logic
- Event-driven communication via Kafka

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Set up Admin Web App
- [ ] Implement Auth Service
- [ ] Implement API Service
    - [ ] Design CRM-based business logic
- [ ] Deploy services to k8s (Minikube)

### Optional
- [ ] Set up Observability Stack
    - [ ] Add metrics collection (Prometheus)
    - [ ] Add centralized logging (e.g. Loki / ELK)
    - [ ] Visualize with Grafana dashboards


---

## Vision

The project is not just a demo, but a continuous process of **learning and experimenting** with distributed systems,  
covering authentication, event-driven communication, caching strategies, observability, and deployment practices.
